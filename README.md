This project is an eccomerce website built with Vue.js as my first use of modern languages and frameworks to create a modern ecommerce website. Previously I created one with PHP, HTML, CSS and Javascript, however I wanted to create a project that uses technologies that most modern businesses use.
<br>
<br>
This project uses a Firebase database in two ways. One is to authenicate a user through a login system to enter the admin page where they can alter exisiting products and add new ones as well as delete products. and the second is to store images for the products themselves where they appear in the product pages next to the item's descriptions.
<br>
<br>
This project also uses GSAP animations to make the front-end more appealing to the end user as well as to appear modern.
<br>
<br>
To use this project you will have to create a firebase account and link your credentials in the Firebase.js file this is due to the possibility of a user going into my account and altering product records if I leave my Firebase.js file intact with the credentials.
